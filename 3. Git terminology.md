#### Repository:

- storage space for our project
- contains one hidden files with .git
- local repo is on our device
- remote repo is somewhere else


#### Clone:

- we can copy an excising git repo from a remote source, so gets all files and history to local device
- we can create remote connection called origin that points your original repository


#### Add and Commit:

- use `git add` to add changes in working directory to staging area, git will include these changes in next commit.
- use `git commit` to commit the changes snap to history
- use `git commit -am "message"` to add message during the commit


#### Push:

-  use `git push` to transfer from local repo to remote repo
- we can use --force to force push (but it is not recommended)
- default branch is master


#### Fetch:

- `git fetch` gets the commits from remote repo, through this we can review and we can merge using `git merge` command


#### Merge:

- When multiple users works on same page/ functionally conflict may happen with changes
- Taking commits/history from one branch and storing to another branch

#### Pull:

- getting remote files or directory to local repo using ` git pull`
- it is combination of `git fetch + git merge = pull`
