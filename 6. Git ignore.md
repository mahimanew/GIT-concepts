#### Git ignore

- git will not track files stored under project_directory/.gitignore


```
touch backup.bkp
touch index.html
touch aa.txt
touch java.class

git status 
```

newly created files will display in git staus, but i do not want to get it, I want to ignore these files

```
vim .gitignore

# then add these content

*.bkp
*.class

git status
# now you can not see that what are all the patterns added in the ignore file those will files are ignored.

```
