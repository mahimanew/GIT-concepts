#### Adding and removing files to git

```
ls 
git status

# we can create new file
vim testfile.txt

#add the below content
this is new file

git status
git commit -am "new file commit"  # but it will not committed because it is brand new file so it shows untracked file error

# so let us add first then commit
git add testfile.txt
git status

git commit -m "new file commit"
git status

# file has added but I want to remove in this situation, so I am going to use rm 
git rm -f testfile.txt
git status


git commit -m "new file deleted"
git status

```
